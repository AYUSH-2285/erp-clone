# ERP Clone
A React-based frontend application mimicking the functionality and design of the ERP system used at PSIT Kanpur.

- React (for building the UI)
- React Router (for page navigation)
- CSS (for styling)
- Node.js and npm (for managing packages)

### Prerequisites:
- Node.js (preferably the latest LTS version)
- npm (comes with Node.js)

### Steps to install:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>

### 5. **Usage**
```markdown
- The app will display the login screen where you can enter your credentials.
- After successful login, you will be redirected to the dashboard.
- Navigation is provided for moving between different sections of the ERP system (though these sections are not functional in this clone yet).
